Collaborate with the Customer Support team to gather details from the client:
When the screen freezes (during card information entry, payment processing, etc.).
Any error messages displayed before the freeze.
Attempts to use different browsers or devices to isolate potential environment-specific issues.

2. Analysis and Troubleshooting:

Work with multiple teams to investigate the cause of the freezing issue:
Frontend Development: Analyze the checkout page code to identify potential JavaScript errors or performance bottlenecks causing the freeze.
Backend Development: Investigate issues with payment processing integration or communication with the payment gateway that might be freezing the screen.
Quality Assurance (QA): Review recent code changes or deployments that might have introduced the issue.

3. Resolution and Implementation:

Depending on the identified cause, the solutions may involve:
Collaboration with Frontend Development to fix JavaScript errors or optimize the checkout page code for smoother performance.
Working with Backend Development to troubleshoot payment processing issues or communication problems with the payment gateway.
If a recent code change is identified, the QA team might be involved in rolling back the changes or implementing a hotfix.
Testing and Verification:

4. Testing and Verification:
After implementing solutions, work with the client and Customer Support to:
Test various payment methods to verify the screen no longer freezes during checkout.
Monitor the system for any recurrence of the freezing issue.
