Case 4:  Resolution of Incorrect Wording in "Amount Due" Email

Reported Issue

The client receives the "Amount Due" email as expected; however, the email body only displays "{amount_due}" instead of the actual amount they owe.

Resolution Steps

1. Verification and Information Gathering:

Collaborate with the Customer Support team to confirm the details:
Obtain a sample of the faulty email, if possible.
Verify the email template used for "Amount Due" notifications.

2. Analysis and Troubleshooting:

Work with the Backend Development team to investigate the issue:
Review the HTML template code using Handlebars.
Identify the cause of the missing value insertion, such as:
Incorrect usage of the Handlebars expression for the "amount_due" variable.
Missing data being passed to the template during email generation.

3. Resolution and Implementation:

Depending on the identified cause, the solution may involve:
Fix the Handlebars expression in the email template. This might involve ensuring the correct syntax is used to reference the "amount_due" data within the template.
If the issue lies with missing data being passed to the template, work with Backend Development to modify the email generation process to include the necessary "amount_due" information.

4. Testing and Verification:

After implementing the solution, collaborate with Backend Development to:
Test the email generation process and verify the "Amount Due" email displays the actual amount owed by the client.
